# Learn Ruby Projects
This repository contains several homework problems that I worked on while I was learning Ruby in the summer of 2017. I had a wonderful mentor named Eben Smith that helped me learn Ruby on the job. At the time, I was a manual QA tester trying to transition to being in a QA Test Automation role. These exercises are basic and embarrassing (have to start somewhere!), but they helped me learn Ruby data structures and fundamentals that were crucial to master if I wanted to write automated test scripts. I'm choosing to keep this repository up because it's kind of a nice reminder that my abilities that I take as granted today were concepts I struggled with a few years ago.
